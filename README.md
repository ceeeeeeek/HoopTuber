# HoopTuber 

**HoopTuber** is a web-based application that allows users to upload basketball game videos and uses AI (YOLOv8, AutoML, PyTorch, Gemini API) to detect basketballs, players, made shots, as well as highlight-worthy moves such as crossovers, dunks, flashy passes etc. The frontend is built with **Next.js** and deployed via **Render**, while the backend runs **FastAPI** with **Gemini API**, hosted on **Railway**.
