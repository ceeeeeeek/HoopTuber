                    Right corner/Right baseline
                    Left corner/Left baseline

                    Time Stamp of Shot (TimeStamp): Identify the exact timestamp of the shot, formatted as HH:MM:SS.
                    Make/Miss (Outcome): Analyze the position of the ball relative to the hoop, the player's follow-through, and the surrounding context (e.g., net movement) to determine the outcome. Conclude whether the shot is a 'Make' or a 'Miss'. If the outcome is not determinable, state 'Undetermined'.
